## Known Limitations

### Placeholder Features (Not in Scope)

   - Full implementation requires form component
   - Not part of current task

2. **Edit Product**: Shows alert (placeholder)
   - Full implementation requires form component
   - Not part of current task

These are intentional placeholders as the task focused on the display, search, filter, and delete functionality.

## Future Enhancements (Not in Current Task)

   - Create product modal/page
   - Edit product modal/page
   - Form validation

2. **Bulk Operations**

   - Bulk status change

3. **Advanced Filters**
   - Filter by category
   - Filter by price range
   - Filter by stock level

4. **Export**
   - Export to CSV
   - Export to PDF
   - Print view

5. **Product Details**
   - Detailed product page
   - Stock history
   - Sales analytics

## How to Test

1. **Start the backend server**
   ```bash
   cd posNew/backend
   npm start
   ```

2. **Start the frontend server**
   ```bash
   cd posNew/frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Login to the application**
   - Use Google OAuth (admin) or credentials (employee)

4. **Navigate to Products page**
   - Click "Productos" in the sidebar

5. **Follow the testing checklist**
   - See `TASK_10_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md`
