### Authentication
- Automatically includes JWT token via API interceptor

- Handles 401/403 errors with redirect to login

## State Management

### Local State
- `searchTerm`: Current search query
- `statusFilter`: Active filter (all/active/inactive)
- `currentPage`: Current pagination page
- `productToDelete`: Product selected for deletion
- `showDeleteModal`: Modal visibility

### Computed State (useMemo)
- `filteredProducts`: Products after search and filter
- `paginatedProducts`: Current page of filtered products
- `totalPages`: Calculated from filtered products

### React Query State
- `products`: All products data
- `isLoading`: Initial load state
- `isError`: Error state
- `isDeleting`: Delete operation state

## User Experience Enhancements

1. **Immediate Feedback**
   - Search updates instantly
   - Filter changes are immediate
   - Loading spinners during operations

2. **Confirmation Dialogs**
   - Delete confirmation modal prevents accidents
   - Shows product details in confirmation
   - Warning about irreversible action

3. **Accessibility**
   - ARIA labels on action buttons
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - Screen reader friendly
   - Semantic HTML structure

4. **Performance**
   - React Query caching (5-minute stale time)
   - useMemo for expensive computations
   - Pagination reduces DOM nodes
   - Optimized re-renders
